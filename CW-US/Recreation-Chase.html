            <h1>The Recreationalist</h1>

            <p class="first-sentence">
                The <b>Recreationalist</b> likes to enjoy things at their own pace. For them, life isn't a race--so why not smell the roses on the way? They enjoy more casual activities such as trying new food or seeing attractions not for their historical or pictorial properties but rather their entertainment value. Seeing a play or participating in a parade are just a few examples of such attractions. They enjoy travel to get away from the busyness of life and to experience new activities, but at a slower pace than an <b>Adventurer</b>, for example. They don't mind historic locations, but they strongly dislike the popular tourist areas or more extreme activities. <b>Recreationalist</b> tends to be a bit older in mind and or body which means they have probably been another type of traveler at one point and have realized it was not all it was cracked up to be.
