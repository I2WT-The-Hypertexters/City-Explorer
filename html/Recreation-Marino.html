                        Seeing some of the world's most famous sights certainly tops everyone's list when traveling in Italy.
                        <br>
                        But taking part in an activity or trying something new, especially something you can share with locals, adds a special dimension to a trip.

                    <h3>Vatican City</h3>
                    <p>
                        Vatican City is actually its own state within Italy, although you can only visit this landlocked area by first travelling to Rome.
                        <br>
                        If you are in the region then you should definitely consider swinging by one of the most important religious spots in the world, which is home to powerhouses such as the Piazza San Pietro and St Peter’s Basilica.

                    <p>
                        No trip to Rome is complete without a trip to the Trevi Fountain, and in fact if you want to return here then it is considered an absolute necessity.
                        <br>
                        Local legend has it that anyone who tosses a coin into the fountain will get good luck that will mean that they will one day return to this great city.
                        <br>
                        The fountain is carved in the Baroque style and is made of glittering marble which is lit up at night to spectacular effect.

                        The journey takes 75 minutes and you can expect to find some of the most beautiful karst formations anywhere in the world here.
                        <br>
                        The inside of the grotto is covered in walkways and lighted areas that let you take in the amazing geology within such as eerie stalactites and stalagmites.

                    <p>
                        The Grand Canal in Venice is one of the most famous waterways in the world and there are a variety of ways that you can enjoy it.
                        <br>
                        One of these is to take a water bus known as a vaporetto along the various parts of the canal where you can marvel at the little bridges and traditional Venetian homes that back onto the water.
                        <br>
                        Another more romantic way to travel around the canal is to take an iconic gondola ride where you can imagine that you are back in the Venice of a different time.

                        Anyone who loves to cook will relish the chance to learn how to make Italy's most famous culinary specialty: perfect pasta.

                    <h3>Tour Tuscan Hill Towns by Bicycle or Car</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tuscany's hilly countryside is best enjoyed at leisure, stopping to explore tiny settlements between the tourist attractions of the larger medieval towns that crown the hilltops. While a driving tour can cover more of these towns, a bicycle gets you closer to the land and gives you time to notice more details.

                            “Spaghetti ai frutti di mare” is mainly a tradition from the central and southern provinces. You can find it with different types of seafood, mussels, clams, razor clams and baby clams, some adding also prawns. The flavor is enhanced by the addition of fresh cherry tomatoes, fresh parsley and extra-virgin olive oil. If you are wondering what are the best foods to eat in Italy, a meal of spaghetti di mare will satisfy your curiosity (and appetite).

                            Gelato or ice cream is one of the most known inventions of Italy,which is generally lower in fat than other styles of frozen desserts. Gelato typically contains 70% less air and more flavouring than other kinds of frozen desserts, giving it a density and richness that distinguishes it from other ice creams.
                            <br>
                            The traditional flavours of gelato consist of vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, pistachio, cream (also known as custard) and stracciatella (fior di latte gelato with chocolate chunks).
