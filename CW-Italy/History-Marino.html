                <h2>Places to visit</h2>

                <h3>The Colosseum</h3>
                <p>
                    The Colosseum is a site like no other. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, nothing represents the sheer power and magnificence of the Roman Empire like this stunning piece of ancient architecture. A visit offers an insight into the lives of Roman citizens and those who had the misfortune of fighting there.
                    <br>
                    In particular, it is now possible to tour the underground hallways and corridors where the gladiators of ancient Rome would prepare to fight and ponder their mortality. Also recently opened are the higher areas of the structure, from where you can take in views of the Roman Forum. There is a museum within the Colosseum with a wealth of interesting artifacts and information and audio guides are available in a number of languages.           
                </p>

                <h3>Leaning Tower of Pisa</h3>
                <p>
                    The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the world’s most famous buildings, particularly due to its leaning stance which leaves it forever appearing to be toppling over. The tower began to lean very early on in its construction, apparently around the time of the construction of its third floor. The reason for the lean is that the ground on which it was built is sandy and unstable and the foundations used for the tower were insufficient to cope with this.
                    <br>
                    Today, visitors can admire the ornate white marble structure and climb the 186 feet to the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa up a staggering 300 steps.
                </p>

                <h3>Saint Mark's Basilica</h3>
                <p>
                    Saint Mark’s Basilica is a world famous Byzantine cathedral in Venice’s St. Mark’s Square, sometimes known as Chiesa d’Oro or “Church of gold”. Every aspect of the basilica is on a grand scale, from its three-part façade with ornate theological carvings to its Greek cross-shaped interior with its ceilings covered in golden mosaics. In fact, the basilica is so elaborate that its entrance or “narthex” is intended to prepare visitors for what they are about to see. 
                    <br>
                    Guided tours are available or an independent walk around St Mark’s Basilica only takes approximately ten minutes to half an hour. There is also a museum and access to the bell tower.
                </p>

                <h3>Duomo di Milano</h3>
                <p>
                    The most visited spot in Milan is its great gothic cathedral, the largest of its kind which can hold up to 40,000 people inside. Its construction began in 1386, with the purpose of modernising the area after Gian Galeazzo Visconti came into power. But even so, it took five whole centuries for the masterpiece to be completed. During this time, many architects, artists and sculptors worked on its construction, resulting in a building which merged the Gothic and Romanesque styles.
                    <br>
                    The Duomo di Milano is covered is beautiful white and pink marble, only upstaged by the openwork pinnacles and spires which decorate the roof. These are adorned with sculptures as well, and as a tourist, you may walk along the roof terrace and appreciate them, as well as the unrivalled views of the city from above.
                </p>

                <h3>Florence Cathedral</h3>
                <p>
                    The Florence Cathedral, once known as the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore in honour of that saint, is the fourth largest cathedral in the world. The building of this great gothic church began at the end of the 13th century, right on atop site of the old church of Santa Reparata (you can still spot these remains in the crypt). However, the great and iconic dome wasn’t added until two hundred years of construction later and only then was the project deemed complete.
                    <br>
                    The architects of the Cathedral, Arnolfo di Cambio and Filippo Brunelleschi, are immortalised through two statues outside the cathedral. They stand admiring its decorative pink, white and green marble exteriors. Just beyond their view in the church’s entrance halls sits the epic 1443 clock which tells time according to the ora italica, meaning its 24-hour days always end at sunset.

            <h2>Things to do</h2>

            <h3>Step Inside Ancient Rome</h3>
            <p>
                An insider tour of one of the landmarks can take you deeper into the history and put the other sites into perspective.
                <br>
                The best place for this is the Colosseum, where newly opened underground areas are accessible by visitors who book in advance and to those on in-depth tours. The latter gives the best introduction to what happened here, as a knowledgeable guide explains the maze of tunnels, passages, and cells deep under the arena floor, where the spectacles delighted Roman audiences.
            </p>

            <h3>See an Opera in Verona's Roman Arena</h3>
            <p>
                You don't need to be an opera lover, or even like music, to be enthralled by the spectacle of a full-scale production in Verona's third-century Roman arena. And for those who do love opera, it's a thrill of a lifetime, right up there with opening night at La Scala.
            </p>

            <h3>Lasagne</h3>
            <p>
                Believed to have originated from the city of Naples, this well-loved and yet another classic Italian dish is made by baking sheets of lasagne pasta layered with cheese, ground meat, vegetables and different varieties of sauces, such as the ragù, bechamel or tomato sauce. This dish should definitely not be missed out on if you want to have a taste of true Italian cuisine.
            </p>

            <h3>Gnocchi alla Sorrentina</h3>
            <p>
                A hearty first course of the Campania tradition, these are potato gnocchi cooked and seasoned with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, parmesan and basil. They are then baked au gratin and served warm.
                <br>
                It’s a pretty simple dish to make but truly irresistible and always a success.
            </p>

            <h3>Arancini</h3>
            <p>
                Crisp and golden brown, arancini refers to a dish of stuffed rice balls. The rice balls are fried after being coated in a dusting of  crunchy breadcrumbs.
                <br>
                These rice balls are usually filled with ragù, tomato sauce, mozzarella and peas. Similar to pasta and pizza dishes in Italy, there are a diversity of regional variations of the arancini. The regional specialties are made with different fillings and shapes depending on the location that the dish is prepared in.
