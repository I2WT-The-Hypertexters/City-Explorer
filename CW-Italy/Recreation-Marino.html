                <p>
                    Vatican City is actually its own state within Italy, although you can only visit this landlocked area by first travelling to Rome.
                    <br>
                    If you are in the region then you should definitely consider swinging by one of the most important religious spots in the world, which is home to powerhouses such as the Piazza San Pietro and St Peter’s Basilica.

                <p>
                    No trip to Rome is complete without a trip to the Trevi Fountain, and in fact if you want to return here then it is considered an absolute necessity.
                    <br>
                    Local legend has it that anyone who tosses a coin into the fountain will get good luck that will mean that they will one day return to this great city.
                    <br>
                    The fountain is carved in the Baroque style and is made of glittering marble which is lit up at night to spectacular effect.

                <p>

                <p>

                    <br>
                    The traditional flavours of gelato consist of vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, pistachio, cream (also known as custard) and stracciatella (fior di latte gelato with chocolate chunks).[8] Fior di latte ("milk flower") is plain, base ice cream with no flavour and no eggs added.
