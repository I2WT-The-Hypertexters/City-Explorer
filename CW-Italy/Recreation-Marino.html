            <p>
                Seeing some of the world's most famous sights certainly tops everyone's list when traveling in Italy. But taking part in an activity or trying something new, especially something you can share with locals, adds a special dimension to a trip.
            </p>

            <h2>Places to visit</h2>

            <h3>Vatican City</h3>
            <p>
                Vatican City is actually its own state within Italy, although you can only visit this landlocked area by first travelling to Rome.

            </p>

            <h3>Trevi Fountain</h3>
            <p>
                No trip to Rome is complete without a trip to the Trevi Fountain, and in fact if you want to return here then it is considered an absolute necessity.
                <br>
                Local legend has it that anyone who tosses a coin into the fountain will get good luck that will mean that they will one day return to this great city.
                <br>
                The fountain is carved in the Baroque style and is made of glittering marble which is lit up at night to spectacular effect.
            </p>

            <h3>Journey into the Frasassi Cave</h3>
            <p>
                The Frasassi Cave is located deep in the grounds of Ancona and descending into this wonderful feat of nature can feel like you are travelling to the center of the earth.
                <br>
                The journey takes 75 minutes and you can expect to find some of the most beautiful karst formations anywhere in the world here.
                <br>
                The inside of the grotto is covered in walkways and lighted areas that let you take in the amazing geology within such as eerie stalactites and stalagmites.

            <h2>Things to do</h2>

            <h3>Glide Through The Grand Canal in a Gondola</h3>
            <p>
                The Grand Canal in Venice is one of the most famous waterways in the world and there are a variety of ways that you can enjoy it.
                <br>
                One of these is to take a water bus known as a vaporetto along the various parts of the canal where you can marvel at the little bridges and traditional Venetian homes that back onto the water.
                <br>
                Another more romantic way to travel around the canal is to take an iconic gondola ride where you can imagine that you are back in the Venice of a different time.

            <h3>Tour Tuscan Hill Towns by Bicycle or Car</h3>

                The traditional flavours of gelato consist of vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, pistachio, cream (also known as custard) and stracciatella (fior di latte gelato with chocolate chunks).[8] Fior di latte ("milk flower") is plain, base ice cream with no flavour and no eggs added.
